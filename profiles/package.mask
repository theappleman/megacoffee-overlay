# py-cashew has officially been broken beyond repair by
# API changes. It is advised to use the plasmoid
# "I Hate The Cashew" instead. Please see:

# This ebuild will be removed some time after June 2014.

# RhodeCode changed to a semi-commercial license back in 2013 which was the
# main reason why this ebuild was abandoned. It should no longer be used due
# to it's age and high amount of dependencies on outdated components.
#
# There's now a fork called Kallithea based on the more recent RhodeCode 2.2
# GPL-licensed part. Kallithea as a whole is licensed GPLv3. We will try to
# supply a virtualenv-based ebuild for it shortly (eliminating the need for
# globally installed dependencies).
